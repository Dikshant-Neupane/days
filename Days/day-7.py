# ##If else 
# a = 33
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:  ##elif is used in python
#   print("a and b are equal")

# a = 200
# b = 33
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")
# elif a == b:
#   print("a and b are equal")
# else:
#   print("a is greater than b")


##Short hand if or one line if statement
# if a > b: print("a is greater than b")


##short hand if esle statement
# a=2
# b=330
# print("A")if a>b else print("B")


####shorthand ifelse condition with threeee contdition
# a = 330
# b = 330
# print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")


####Or keyword as logical operator used to combine conditional statement

# a=200
# b=33
# c=500
# if a>b or a>c :
#     print(f"A is the most greatest with value {a}")



####  not keyword is a logical operator, used to reverse the result of the conditional statement 

a=200
# b=33
# c=500
# if not a>b:
#     print("a is not the greatest") ##this statement wont comes as ouptut as a is greater than b and using not make it false
# else:
#     print("a is greater than b")
    
    
    
    ####    Nested if 
# x=40
# if x>10:
#          print("above ten")
#          if x == 0:
#              print(" x is zero")
             
# else :
#                print("smallar than 10")


#### Pass the statement used so that if there is no content in if statemtn then  using pass can aviod getting error 
# a=33
# b=200
# if b>a:
#      pass
