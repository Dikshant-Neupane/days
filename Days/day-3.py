# ########  UNPACKING Tuples

# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

# (green, yellow, red) = fruits

# print(green)
# print(yellow)
# print(red)

# ############## Using asterik **

# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "strawberry", "raspberry")

# (green, yellow, *red) = fruits

# print(green)#gets apple as its the first 
# print(yellow)#gets banana
# print(red)###gets all the remaining elements


# fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")

# (green, *tropic, red) = fruits#when * is at the middle

# print(green)#gets the first one
# print(tropic)#remaining
# # print(red)#gets the last one


# ########## LOOPS in tuples
# fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")
# for x in fruits :
#     print(x)###prints the output in queue

# for i in range(len(fruits)):
#     print(fruits[i])

############  Using While LOOPS
# i=0
# while i<len(fruits):
#     print(fruits[i])
#     i=i+1


################ JOINING TUPLES

# tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
# tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

# tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
# print(tuple3)


# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# mytuple = fruits * 2

# print(mytuple)
